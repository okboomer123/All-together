<p2><font size="5">During this class we had to create five different website including this one. The first site we created was one about the CoronaVirus which is somthing that has forced us to take online classes instead of being at school. The second project was about the possible stress of social distancing and what you can do to releave stress. The third Project was a less bland one about an important time in your life or and important event that impacted you as a person. The fourth project was teaching us how to live of $1,200 for an unknown time by handling bills and food costs and possible loans you had. The last project is the one that I am currently writing which is a paragragh of what I and my other classmates had to do during the past two weeks</font></p2>
